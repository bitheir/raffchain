Step-by-Step Guide: Uploading Your NFT Collection to IPFS
========================================================

This guide will help you upload your NFT images and metadata to IPFS, using beginner-friendly services. You will also learn how to update your metadata files with the correct IPFS links.

---

1. **Prepare Your Files**
------------------------
- Ensure all your images (JPGs) and their corresponding metadata JSON files are in a single folder.
- The metadata JSON files should have been generated by the provided Python script.

2. **Choose an IPFS Pinning Service**
-------------------------------------
Popular options:
- [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) (free tier available)
- [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/) (free, recommended for NFTs)

3. **Create an Account**
-----------------------
- Go to your chosen service and sign up for a free account.

4. **Upload Your Images**
------------------------
- Log in to your pinning service dashboard.
- Find the option to upload files or folders.
- Upload all your JPG images at once (as a folder if possible).
- After upload, you will receive a folder CID (Content Identifier). This is your IPFS hash for the images folder.
- Note the CID (e.g., `bafy...`).

5. **Update Metadata Files with IPFS Links**
-------------------------------------------
- Each metadata JSON file has an `image` field like:
  `"image": "ipfs://<CID>/<FILENAME>"`
- Replace `<CID>` with your actual images folder CID.
- Example: If your CID is `bafybeihd...` and the image is `Llama #002.jpg`, the field should be:
  `"image": "ipfs://bafybeihd.../Llama #002.jpg"`
- You can do this manually or with a script (ask for help if needed).

6. **Upload Metadata Files to IPFS**
-----------------------------------
- Repeat the upload process, but this time upload all your JSON metadata files as a folder.
- You will get a new CID for the metadata folder. This is the root for your NFT metadata.

7. **Verify Your Files**
-----------------------
- You can view your files on IPFS gateways:
  - Images: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>/<FILENAME>`
  - Metadata: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<METADATA_CID>/<JSON_FILENAME>`

8. **Using Metadata in NFT Minting**
------------------------------------
- When minting NFTs, use the metadata URI:
  `ipfs://<METADATA_CID>/<JSON_FILENAME>`
- Most NFT platforms and smart contracts support IPFS URIs.

**Tips:**
- Keep your CIDs safe; they are the permanent address of your files on IPFS.
- If you update files, you must re-upload and use the new CID.
- For large collections, scripts can automate updating the metadata files.

**Need more help?**
- Visit the documentation of your chosen service (Pinata, NFT.Storage).
- Ask for help with scripts or automation if you have many files.
